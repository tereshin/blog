# Skill: clarify

Ambiguity sweep over a written `spec.md`. It hunts the spec for under-specified points — vague terms, unmeasured NFRs, AC missing error/authz/edge behavior, unstated assumptions, conflicting requirements, undefined domain terms, missing actors, scope creep — then dispatches a **clean-context devil's-advocate subagent** that re-reads the spec fresh and answers one question: *where would two engineers reasonably build different things from this?* Each ambiguity it surfaces is closed with the user: either **resolved** (the spec is tightened in place) or **deferred** (a §8 Open-Questions row with owner + due). It exists so `glossary` / `design` never proceed on an ambiguous spec.

This is a sweep, not a full authoring stage — it does **not** run the shared Socratic loop or the coherence critic. Its shared dependencies:
→ [`../_shared/critic.md`](../_shared/critic.md) (clean-context **dispatch discipline** only — the subagent here hunts AMBIGUITY, not coherence drift) · [`../_shared/ask-style.md`](../_shared/ask-style.md) (resolve/defer question phrasing).

Depth governs how aggressively the sweep hunts + the per-finding question volume → [`../_shared/interview-depth.md`](../_shared/interview-depth.md). (Every surfaced ambiguity is still Resolved or Deferred at every level — that's a floor, not a dial.)

Spec tightenings follow `artifact_language` — but the **existing spec's language wins** over the setting (never retro-translate mid-sweep); headings and machine tokens stay English → [`../_shared/artifact-language.md`](../_shared/artifact-language.md).

## Owner

PM + Tech Lead (the spec's co-authors resolve their own ambiguities). PM owns vague-term / scope / missing-actor calls; Tech Lead owns unmeasured-NFR / under-specified-AC / conflicting-requirement calls.

## Inputs

- `<slug>` — same feature slug used by `specify`.
- **Gate (hard-refuse if missing):** `docs/features/<slug>/spec.md`. Absent → STOP and point: «run `specify <slug>` first — clarify sharpens an existing spec, it does not write one».
- (Optional) `CONTEXT.md` — two-level: read **both** repo-root (project-wide) and `docs/features/<slug>/CONTEXT.md` (feature-scoped; wins on conflict) → [`../glossary/SKILL.md`](../glossary/SKILL.md); if present, `## Glossary` is canonical; an "undefined-term" finding for a word already glossed at either level is a false positive (drop it).
- **Fast lane (XS/S):** when `specify` produced zero §8 open questions and flagged no ambiguous AC, the skip of this stage is offered by **`specify`'s handoff** (→ the fast lane in [`../_shared/size-matrix.md`](../_shared/size-matrix.md)) — the user takes it there; clarify itself never auto-skips.

## Protocol

1. **Gate + set interview depth.** `test -f docs/features/<slug>/spec.md` → missing = refuse with the pointer above. Read the spec (and `## Glossary` from both root `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/features/<slug>/CONTEXT.md` if present — per-feature wins — to suppress false "undefined-term" hits). **Then set the interview depth (the opening question):** read `interview_depth` from `.claude/sdd.local.md` if present (else default medium), and — unless a `--depth=easy|medium|hard` arg was passed — ask ONE depth-selection `AskUserQuestion` phrased per [`../_shared/ask-style.md`](../_shared/ask-style.md), with the saved/medium value as the «(Recommended)» first option. The level tunes how adversarially the sweep + subagent hunt (easy: only build-divergence that changes behavior, with assumptions stated; medium: balanced; hard: adversarial, every fork surfaced) and the per-finding question volume → [`../_shared/interview-depth.md`](../_shared/interview-depth.md).
2. **First-pass self-sweep.** Walk the spec against the eight ambiguity classes in [`./references/ambiguity-checks.md`](./references/ambiguity-checks.md) (vague-term / unmeasured-NFR / under-specified-AC / unstated-assumption / conflicting-requirement / undefined-term / missing-actor / scope-creep). Note candidate findings with a `§ref` each — do not edit yet.
3. **Devil's-advocate subagent (the core mechanic).** Dispatch the [`devils-advocate`](../../agents/devils-advocate.md) agent — `subagent_type: "sdd:devils-advocate"` (model per `judgment_model`, roster default `opus`; effort `high`; clean context — it never saw this conversation). Pass only the slug + the spec path; it Reads `spec.md` (and `CONTEXT.md`) itself — inline nothing — and returns "two engineers would diverge here" findings. The dispatch follows the contract in [`../_shared/agent-roster.md`](../_shared/agent-roster.md) (clean-isolated context, cited findings, `NO_AMBIGUITIES` if none). If `devils-advocate` is unavailable at runtime, fall back to a `general-purpose` Agent with the prompt body in [`./references/ambiguity-checks.md`](./references/ambiguity-checks.md).
4. **Merge + dedupe.** Union the self-sweep (step 2) with the subagent findings (step 3); collapse duplicates (same `§ref` + same class). Keep the highest-impact first (conflicting-requirement > under-specified-AC > unmeasured-NFR > undefined-term > missing-actor > scope-creep > vague-term > unstated-assumption). If the merged set is empty → report «spec is unambiguous», stamp nothing, suggest `glossary`/`design`.
5. **Resolve or defer, per finding.** For each finding, one `AskUserQuestion` phrased per [`../_shared/ask-style.md`](../_shared/ask-style.md), offering: **Resolve now** (user picks/dictates the tightening) · **Defer to §8** (→ Open-Questions row, owner + due captured in a follow-up; missing either = stays unresolved, re-ask once) · **Not an ambiguity** (false positive — drop it, e.g. a term already in CONTEXT). Every finding ends Resolved or Deferred — none dangling. **Depth tunes the question volume, not the floor:** at `easy`, the skill resolves the unambiguous, low-stakes findings itself with sensible tightenings and lists them in a stated-assumptions ledger for a batch veto, asking only the behavioral/high-stakes forks; at `hard`, it asks every finding. The «zero dangling» rule holds at every level.
6. **Write resolutions back.** Apply Resolve edits in the spec's native section (tighten the §5 AC into business-observable form, replace a §6 adjective with a numeric target + measurement, fix a §1 term, add a missing §4 actor/US, cut a §3 scope-creep line). Append every Defer as a §8 checkbox row `- [ ] <question>? Default now: <X>. — owner: <name/role>, due: <date or stage>`. Keep a short edits-log (one line per finding: `class · §ref · resolved|deferred · before→after`).
   - **Undefined-term findings reconcile the glossary in-flow (a hard rule, at every depth).** When an `undefined-term` finding is Resolved, immediately invoke `glossary <slug>` for that term — compare it against `CONTEXT.md` and add/update the definition **now**, not as a deferred note. clarify never resolves a term by inventing a meaning inline; the canonical definition lands in `CONTEXT.md` so `design`/downstream read one source.
7. **Stamp + commit.** Set `updated_at: <today>` in the frontmatter. Re-respect `specify`'s invariants when tightening (§5 AC stays free of HTTP/status/error-code/SQL tokens; §6 numbers carry a measurement; §4 roles only from the glossary). Propose `clarify: <slug> — N resolved, M deferred`. Then **emit the stage-handoff block** per [`../_shared/handoff.md`](../_shared/handoff.md) — *What I did* (incl. the terms already reconciled into `CONTEXT.md` by step 6's in-flow `glossary` calls — the user learns here that the glossary changed, not later) + *Review* (tightened `spec.md`, + `CONTEXT.md` when terms were added) + *Run next* — **resolve the next stage per `.route`** (Routes in [`../_shared/size-matrix.md`](../_shared/size-matrix.md)): forward `/sdd:glossary <slug>` ↳ or the next backbone stage to skip the glossary hop — that stage is `/sdd:ux-flows <slug>`, unless `ux-flows`' N/A condition holds (**no human-facing UI** — every §4 actor a system/service, or the repo has no UI at all, per the size-matrix fast lane), in which case it's `/sdd:design <slug>` (on `quick` — terms were already reconciled in-flow, so auto-resolve straight to that backbone stage unless unglossed terms remain; on `full` — keep both options, no auto-resolve).

## Definition of Done

- Every ambiguity from the self-sweep + the subagent is **Resolved** (spec tightened in its native section) or **Deferred** (a §8 row with both owner AND due) — zero dangling.
- Resolve edits preserve `specify`'s contracts: §5 AC carry no HTTP/status/error-code/SQL tokens, §6 NFR rows carry a numeric target + measurement (no adjectives), §4 roles match the CONTEXT glossary.
- The devil's-advocate subagent actually ran (clean context, Read the spec itself) — not skipped, not paraphrased into the main thread.
- `updated_at` reflects today; edits-log kept; commit proposed.
- The devil's-advocate sweep + the zero-dangling resolution rule are this skill's **structural self-check** ([`../_shared/self-check.md`](../_shared/self-check.md)); its result is reported in the handoff.

## Anti-patterns

- **Skipping the subagent** and sweeping only in-thread. The clean-context fork-finder is the core mechanic — the self-sweep is shaped by the conversation that wrote the spec and misses its own blind spots.
- **Resolving an ambiguity unilaterally** (no `AskUserQuestion`). clarify proposes; the author decides — the same user-in-the-loop contract as every SDD stage.
- **Defer without owner+due** — a §8 row missing either is not a real defer; re-ask once, else it stays unresolved.
- **Re-running the coherence critic here.** That F1–F6 cross-section drift check belongs to `specify`/`design`; clarify's subagent hunts *ambiguity* (build-divergence), a different target.
- **Leaking implementation into a Resolve edit** — tightening a §5 AC by adding a status code / endpoint / SQL detail. Stay business-observable; the technical mapping lives in `api` / `data-model`.
- **Inventing answers to fill findings.** A genuinely open point is *deferred* with an owner, not guessed — better an honest §8 row than a fabricated AC.
- **Authoring new scope.** clarify sharpens what the spec already says; a brand-new requirement goes back through `specify`, not in under cover of a "clarification".
